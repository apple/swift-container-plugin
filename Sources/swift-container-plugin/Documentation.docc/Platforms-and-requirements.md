# Installing dependencies

* Swift Container Plugin runs on macOS and Linux and requires Swift 6.0 or later.
* On macOS you must install a cross-compilation Swift SDK, such as the [Swift Static Linux SDK](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html), in order to build executables which can run on Linux-based cloud infrastructure.
* A container runtime is not required to build an image, but one must be available wherever the image is to be run.
